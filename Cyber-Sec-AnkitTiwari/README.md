## üîê Cybersecurity Features

### üî• 1. *Breach Monitoring Alerts*
> ‚úÖ **What:** Displays real-time alerts for any detected data breach, suspicious logins, or firewall bypasses.
> 
> üß† **Why:** Quick visibility into unauthorized access attempts or sensitive data leaks.
> 
> üîê **Benefit:** Helps the security team respond immediately. Protects data integrity and minimizes damage during a breach.

---

### ü§ñ 2. *AI Threat Scanner*
> ‚úÖ **What:** Scans your system and files using an AI model trained to detect malware patterns, phishing attempts, and zero-day threats.
> 
> üß† **Why:** Traditional scanning relies on known signatures; AI can predict unknown or evolving threats based on behavior and patterns.
> 
> üîê **Benefit:** Proactive defense. Helps detect hidden or new threats before they cause damage.

---

### üõ° 3. *Cyber Hygiene Score*
> ‚úÖ **What:** Scores your system or personal security practices (e.g., password strength, 2FA usage, update status).
> 
> üß† **Why:** People often ignore basic security hygiene until it‚Äôs too late.
> 
> üîê **Benefit:** Encourages users to maintain good digital habits. Think of it like a ‚Äúcredit score‚Äù for your cybersecurity health.

---

### üéØ 4. *Attack Simulation Dashboard*
> ‚úÖ **What:** Simulates phishing, brute-force, and SQL injection attacks on a test system.
> 
> üß† **Why:** ‚ÄúPractice like you play.‚Äù You must know how your systems react under attack conditions.
> 
> üîê **Benefit:** Helps teams identify weaknesses, train staff, and implement fixes before a real hacker finds them.

---

### üîê 5. *Secure Password Vault*
> ‚úÖ **What:** Encrypted password manager built into the platform.
> 
> üß† **Why:** Reusing weak passwords is one of the top vulnerabilities in the world.
> 
> üîê **Benefit:** Helps users store strong, unique passwords securely ‚Äî protected with encryption and biometric/2FA access.

---

### üìç 6. *Location-Based Login Alerts*
> ‚úÖ **What:** Sends notifications when logins occur from unusual or geographically distant locations.
> 
> üß† **Why:** If a user logs in from India and then suddenly from Brazil ‚Äî that‚Äôs suspicious.
> 
> üîê **Benefit:** Stops account takeovers in real-time. Allows users to deny or flag access attempts.

---

### üß¨ 7. *Zero Trust Login System*
> ‚úÖ **What:** Enforces multi-step authentication for every login/session based on role, location, device, and risk.
> 
> üß† **Why:** ‚ÄúNever trust, always verify.‚Äù This is modern enterprise-grade security.
> 
> üîê **Benefit:** Even if credentials are stolen, attackers can‚Äôt access anything sensitive without re-verifying.

---

### üß™ 8. *Interactive Security Labs*
> ‚úÖ **What:** Real-time hacking/defense labs for users to learn ethical hacking, penetration testing, and secure coding.
> 
> üß† **Why:** Theory isn‚Äôt enough ‚Äî hands-on learning sticks better.
> 
> üîê **Benefit:** Educates users and devs. Helps your team build more secure systems, reducing overall risk.

---

### üïµ 9. *Malicious File & Link Analyzer*
> ‚úÖ **What:** Lets users upload suspicious files or paste links ‚Äî the system uses AI + signatures to scan them.
> 
> üß† **Why:** Email attachments and links are top malware delivery channels.
> 
> üîê **Benefit:** Prevents phishing, ransomware, or trojan infections. A valuable tool for both users and admins.

---

### üì± 10. *Session & Device Management Dashboard*
> ‚úÖ **What:** Shows where and how a user is logged in (devices, IP, location). Lets them terminate sessions.
> 
> üß† **Why:** Attackers often persist in background sessions even after a password change.
> 
> üîê **Benefit:** Gives users control. Stops unauthorized devices quickly. Adds transparency and protection.

---

### üíº Bonus: Business Value Add
- These features show that *you‚Äôre thinking like a cybersecurity product designer*, not just a developer.
- This can *attract enterprise clients, boost credibility, and increase user trust and retention*.
- They‚Äôre also *future-proof*, aligning with security standards like **ISO 27001**, **GDPR**, and **NIST**.

## üîß Installation & Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ankit2004tiwari/Cyber-Sec.git
cd Cyber-Sec
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env

DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_USER=root
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_password
DATABASE_NAME=cyber_security_db
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
```

### 4. Configure MySQL Database

Create the database and required tables:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE cyber_security_db;

USE cyber_security_db;

CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  password VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Repeat for other tables like security_logs, security_alerts
```

üìÑ Full schema is available in `/docs/database-schema.sql`
